Loading Data:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
House <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gedeck/practical-statistics-for-data-scientists/master/data/house_sales.csv")

```

Process Data
```{r}
House$AdjSalePriceK <- House$AdjSalePrice / 1000
``` 

```{r}
boxplot(AdjSalePriceK ~ NewConstruction, data = House)
```
There is not a significant effect of new construction or not on price. Maybe variables explain it.


```{r}
boxplot(AdjSalePriceK ~ PropertyType, data = House) 
```

```{r}
boxplot(AdjSalePriceK ~ Bedrooms, data = House)
```

```{r}
boxplot(AdjSalePriceK ~ Bathrooms, data = House)
```

```{r}
boxplot(AdjSalePriceK ~  TrafficNoise, data = House)
```
